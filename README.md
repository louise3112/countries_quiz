# Countries Quiz

Group project from Week 10 of CodeClan using JavaScript / React, Express, MongoDB and styled components.


## Brief
Design a full-stack app using the Countries API data where users can:
- play multiple, interactive quiz games;
- see their quiz scores and have them retained, even if they leave the app;
- view underlying information for each country so they can improve their quiz scores.
