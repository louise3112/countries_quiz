# Countries Quiz

Group project from Week 10 of the CodeClan Professional Software Development course. This is a full-stack app that uses a JavaScript / React front-end designed using styled components; an Express server; and a MongoDB back-end.


## Brief
Design a full-stack app using the Countries API data where users can:
- play multiple, interactive quiz games;

- see their quiz scores and have them retained, even if they leave the app;
- view underlying information for each country so they can improve their quiz scores.
