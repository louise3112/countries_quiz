# JavaScript Project Brief
Team: Louise, Maggie, Jonathan & Gareth

## MVP
A user shoudld be able to:
- play an interactive quiz game based on the countries data API;
- see their results updated after each guess / round;
- have their results stored in a mongoDB database;
- access underlying information for all countries so they can improve their quiz scores.

## Potential Extensions
- Extend the app to incorporate multiple quiz games of different styles.
- Use map / chart packages to display data from quizzes, e.g. % won / lost, scores by category.
- Apply media queries to allow proper display in both mobile and desktop.
- Add CI / CD to make app live and include testing.
