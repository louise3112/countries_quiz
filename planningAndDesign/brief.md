# JavaScript Project Brief
Team: Louise, Maggie, Jonathan & Gareth

## MVP
Use an API to bring in relevant data, clean it and store in a mongoDB database.
A user should be able to:
- play an interactive quiz game.
- see their results in a visually fun way!

## Extensions
- Extend the app to incorporate multiple quiz game options.
- Add CI / CD to make app live and include testing.
- Use map / chart packages to extend visual displays.
- Apply media queries to allow proper display in both mobile and desktop.
