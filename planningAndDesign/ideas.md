# Ideas for Countries API Project

Multiple games each with different playing style (e.g. going on forever, only allowed to get 3 wrong, or set number of questions) - will need to set playing style to each game type as makes sense.
Incorporate level of difficulty for games where sensible (e.g. population comparisons)


## Game Ideas
- Flag quiz - multiple choice options. Option to filter to flags of a specific region (continents?)
- Language quiz - multiple choice options, same format as flags but would need to make sure "wrong" answers weren't other official languages!
- Guess capital city - type in country (auto-fill support or dropdown)
- Play Your Populations Right! - higher / lower on population of countries, to increase difficulty could have different bands of population size to compare against.
- Directional Quiz - compared to given country, what direction does X country lie? Ideally would have compass visual with ability to pick standard 8 directions. Jonathan to look at this + buttons. Alternative would be to just have east / west decision. Would need to have a map in background to show definitive "ends" of east / west!! Could also increase difficulty with banding similar to population option.


## Other things
- Have a results / stats page that shows you your results / stats for each game. Could include info on regions you're best / worst at etc.
- Have a countries info page where you can see details of each country (e.g. flag, capital city, population, location, google links etc.). Option to filter by region etc.
- Design stuff for Jonathan. Nav bar down the side with main pages (e.g. Games, Country Info, Stats) - have this on all pages. Think about logo. Keep game pages clean. On 'Games' page, have flexbox displaying 'card' for each game with image, name etc. that can then be clicked on to play game.


## Database Side
In seeds file, do fetch on countries API. Clean / trim down data. Add objects required for game data. Then chuck into database.
